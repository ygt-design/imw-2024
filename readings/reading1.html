        <h2>
            What is the thesis of this article?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This article argues that websites written by hand and not software should be considered “handmade” because
            people rather than corporations or businesses maintain them. J.R. Carpenter states that this era of the
            internet took place in the mid to late 1990s. She first correlates the handmade web with handmade print
            materials to support her thesis, explaining the symbiotic relationship between print and digital: things
            included in the web pages and printed material “‘continue to exist in the medium they were created.” Her
            next use of the handmade web is that advocate for the engagement of web pages and policies. The expectation
            that everyone would have their site in the 90s, instead of the social media platforms we have today,
            resulted in more intimate websites that allowed people to show whatever they desired. Carpenter’s third and
            fourth points bring the manual labour involved in writing web pages; and creating a handbook for computers
            to run your page. Visitors to the web page can view the source code and even copy parts of it for their
            page. Finally, the carpenter states that in a world where the web is highly commercialized and written by
            software, writing code by yourself is an act of resistance and something that drives her to use it in a
            poetic and unyielding way.

            Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the broader sense, I think capitalism is being resisted. Carpenter mentions the commercialization of web
            pages by corporations multiple times in the article. Particularly drawing attention to how individuality is
            lost with the uniform way pages are constructed, taking away from the individuality that the mid to late 90s
            brought with independently written web pages. Especially with social media becoming such a large part of the
            online experience, the majority of internet users have lost touch with the individuality and intimacy that
            comes with creating your niche site. And yes, there are pages on sites such as Reddit and Facebook that
            serve as hubs for specific communities. However, creating a website for that niche community itself allows
            for so much possibility in how they present themselves and how they want fellow members to interact with the
            site and each other. The commercialization of the web removes the individual from the process and output of
            the web. By creating our pages, we go against the impersonal web, bringing back the charm and curiosity that
            came with the handmade web.

            Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the “physicality” of the
            web?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first example of drawing attention to the physicality that comes to mind is virtual exhibitions. Last
            year, I visited the KAWS exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Towards the end of the physical exhibit,
            some installations were based on augmented reality (AR), in which the viewer scans a barcode and can view
            the virtual 3D rendering of the KAWS mascot in the gallery. This brings the physical gallery space together
            with the virtual gallery, highlighting the intersection of the two realms. Exhibits like this, further
            immerse the viewer, with this interactive element. Making the gallery visitors curious about what they
            cannot see in the tangible world and what they can see in virtual reality. Going back to Carpenter’s
            article, we cannot see all the programming that went on behind the scenes to make the sculpture appear. It
            further removes us from the handmade web but leaves room for some to question what went into everything that
            we see…
